### Support

Running into a problem that might not actually be a bug?  Try the following before submitting an issue.

#### Gitter

We try to stay reasonably active in gitter chat.  If you need support, often the fastest response will come from [our gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/nelsam/vidar).

#### Email

If you don't have the time to chat in gitter or your issue isn't urgent, feel free to email [the original author](https://github.com/nelsam).

#### Be Patient

We're working on this in our free time, as a hobby.  We really do want to help, and we want the project to be successful, but we have real jobs and lives.  We may not
always have time to help out.
